# Length-of-Stay-Prediction-for-Heart-Disease-Patients
## Introduction:
This project utilizes the CMS DE-SynPUF dataset (2008â€“2010) to analyze healthcare patterns of heart disease patients by linking beneficiary, inpatient, outpatient, and prescription files. Focusing on a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries, the aim is to explore factors affecting hospital length of stay (LOS). The analysis emphasizes the impact of comorbidities, medication use, and healthcare services, using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and inform predictive modeling.
